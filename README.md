# ObjectiveKit
ObjectiveKit provides a Swift-friendly API for a set of powerful Objective C runtime functions.

## Usage


### Setting up with [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/?q=ObjectiveKit)
```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
pod 'ObjectiveKit', '~> 0.1'
```

### Setting up with Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that automates the process of adding frameworks to your Cocoa application.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate Interpolate into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "marmelroy/ObjectiveKit"
```
